[255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/) **üí∏premiumüí∏** 

Use mono stack to emulate & verify pre-order traversal
- Emulate:
  - Node at the top of the stack is the root of the subtree we're visiting rn.
  - Push nodes when we're visiting deep down (go to the left subtree) & pop nodes when we need to backtrack up the tree (go back to the right subtree)
- Verify:
  -  When we return from a node (pop from the stack), every value we encounter from now on must be greater than node.
